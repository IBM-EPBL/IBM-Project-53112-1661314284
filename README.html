<h4><p>&#128372;INTRODUCTION:<br></h4>
                           Detection and recognition of plant diseases using machinelearning are very efficient in providing symptoms of identifying diseases at its earliest. Plant pathologists can analyze the digital images using digital image processing for diagnosis of plant diseases. Application of computer vision and image
processing strategies simply assist farmers in all of the regionsof agriculture. Generally, the plant diseases are caused by the abnormal physiological functionalities of plants. Therefore, the characteristic symptoms are generated based on the differentiation between normal physiological functionalities and abnormal physiological functionalities of the plants. Mostly, the plant leaf diseases are caused by Pathogens which are positioned on the stems of the plants. These different symptoms and diseases of leaves are predicted by different methods in image processing. These different methods include different fundamental processes like segmentation, feature
extraction and classification and so on. Mostly, the prediction and diagnosis of leaf diseases are depending on the segmentation such as segmenting the healthy tissues from diseased tissues of leaves.

<h4><p>&#128532;PROBLEM STATEMENT:<br></h4>
In India, The Agriculture industry is extremely vital and crucial for economic and social development and jobs. In India, the agricultural sector provides a living for almost 48% of the population. As per the 2019-2020 economic survey, an Indian farmer's median wage in 16 states is Rupees 2500. Most of the Indian population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture gives an opportunity of employment to the village people to develop a country like India on large scale and give a push in the economic sector. The majority of farmers face the problem of planting an inappropriate crop for their land based on a conventional or non-scientific approach. This is a challenging task for a country like India, where agriculture feeds approximately 42% of the population. And the outcomes for the farmer of choosing the wrong crop for land is moving towards metro city for livelihoods, suicide, quitting the agriculture and give land on lease to industrialist or use for the non-agriculture purpose. The outcome of wrong crop selection is less yield and less profit.

<h4><p>&#128532;PROBLEM SOLUTION:<br></h4>
The solution to the problem is Machine learning, which is one of the applications of Artificial Intelligence, is being used to implement the proposed system. Crop recommendation is going to recommend you the best crop you can grow in your land as per the soil nutrition value and along with as per the climate in that region. And recommending the best fertilizer for every particular crop is also a challenging task. And the other and most important issue is when a plant gets caught by heterogeneous diseases that effect on less amount of agriculture production and compromises with quality as well. To overcome all these issues this recommendation has been proposed . Nowadays a lot of research and work is being implemented in the smart and modern agriculture domain. Crop recommendation is characterized by a soil database comprised of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, potassium. The ensembles technique is used to build a recommendation model that combines the prediction of multiple machine learning. Models to recommend the right crop based on soil value and the best fertilizer to use.
